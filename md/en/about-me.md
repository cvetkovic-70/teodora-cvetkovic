Master Clinical Psychologist with additional education through dual studies at the International Psychoanalytic University in Berlin. Through engagement with professors from around the world, I have developed numerous psychoanalytic techniques, focusing on in-depth work at the individual, couples, and family levels. I am an active member of a psychotherapy group under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Nicolás Lorenzini and Prof. Dr. Gamze Özcürümez Bilgili, as well as a research group at the [International Psychoanalytic University in Berlin](https://www.ipu-berlin.de/introducing-ipu-alumni-topic-ambassadors/).
